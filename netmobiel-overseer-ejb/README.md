# netmobiel-overseer-ejb

`Overseer` is the implementation of the orchestration and coordination service for the NetMobiel Mobility-As-A-Service platform. The `Overseer` listens for events generated by the components of Netmobiel. The overseer decides whether messages are sent to involved persons, and whether exchange of credits is initiated.

 
## Project setup
After checking out from GitHub the project is ready for use.

## Design
The design of the overseer service is rather compact. The event handling is based on the Java EE CDI events, in combination with simple event qualifiers.
  
## Configuration
No configuration is required. All wiring is hard-coded.

The `Overseer` has no persistence capabilities of itself.

### Compiles and builds the EJB 
```
mvn install
```
### Run your unit tests and integration tests
```
mvn verify
```
Because of the complexity in setting up fixtures for the simulation of orchestration requirements, the test effort is deferred to functional tests for the whole platform.
