# netmobiel-rideshare-ejb

`Rideshare` is the implementation of the rideshare service for the NetMobiel Mobility-As-A-Service platform. The EJB jar contains the business logic.
 
## Project setup
After checking out from GitHub the project is ready for use.

## Design
Refer to the [design page](doc/design.md) for a global description of the rideshare service.
  
## Configuration
The rideshare service component requires the definition of the rideshareDS datasource in WildFly and a few JNDI definitions. Refer to the [detailed instructions](doc/configuration.md) to setup the database and database connection, and also the required JNDI definitions. 

The database schema must be manually created for development, acceptance and production stages. 

The test database is automatically populated by the integration tests. Use the test schema generated by Hibernate JPA as inspiration to setup and maintain the correct schema.
